Although this page is labelled as a "quick-start", it might not be as quick as you think. Indeed, you'll first need to get all the relevant parts. For this, see the [Parts Choice section]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/dive-down/hardware/#parts-choices) of the hardware dive-down.

Once you have all the parts, you'll have to put them together. For that, two options stand in front of you: custom PCB and protoboard. Both options are reasoned about in our hardware dive-down and, although custom PCB is the desired one, we have opted for protoboard mainly due to lack of time. A detailed description on how to solder everything together can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/dive-down/hardware/#protoboard-steps)

Congrats! You should now have all the parts soldered together and ready to work! Just plug them in a battery and... Wait, have we not forgotten anything? Well, for now, we've only got "bare-metal" hardware, which is not programmed to do anything. We must therefore program the ESP32, our glasses' brain. For that, simply flash our firmware, as explained [here](),or thoroughly read the whole dive-down to help you make your own!
